## Biography 

I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Pakistan, and Chonbuk National University, Jeonju,
South Korea, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in robotics and mechatronics engineering from the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, South Korea,
in 2023.

Currently, I am a Research Fellow at Camera Culture Group, DGIST. My research focuses on developing robust AI-driven solutions for medical image analysis, including classification, detection, and segmentation. I am particularly interested in video domain adaptation, visual-language representation learning, and generative AI for medical imaging. M
